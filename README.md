## Installation

1. Ensure you run the following commands when you have properly uploaded to your desired hosting service:

```bash
composer install
npm run install
```

2. Connect to your database in the `.env` file, currently labeled as `.env.example`, so make sure to correctly rename that and then run the following command after configuring your db settings:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=apl
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=StorageSettingSeeder
php artisan migrate
```

3. Remember to also configure Azure for image uploading, in your `.env` file.

```
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=your_account_name
AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=your_storage_key
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=apl-recruitment-images
AZURE_STORAGE_URL=your_url
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
```

4. Then visit your browser after running the following command. You should be able to now explore the contents of the app, enjoy!

```bash
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

5. Incase you run into issues with storage, try running the following:

```
php artisan storage:link
```

6. If you are looking to test the app, please remember to add your config similar to the `.env` variables. 

```
<server name="DB_CONNECTION" value="mysql"/>
<server name="DB_DATABASE" value="test_db"/>
<server name="DB_USERNAME" value="..."/>
<server name="DB_PASSWORD" value="..."/>
```

7. To run the tests, just do:

```
php artisan test
```

## Improvements that could be done with more time

- Could've dade the components more reusable so I didnâ€™t have to repeat myself and made it more accessible
- Could've added roles and permissions to allow access to users with certain permissions
- Could've done a headless approach using backend as API and frontend React
- Could've added cron jobs to retrieve images from azure every half an hour to update local storage
- Ability to support more sizes for imges that are less than 1024 for responsive images, therefore improving wider performance
- Coudl've added a loading state whilst images are loading, which required a lot of frontend work
- On image preview, I could've added zoom functionality for UX
